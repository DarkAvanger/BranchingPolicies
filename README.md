# Concept

Branching Policies are rules that help to maintain control and improve the quality code of your project. These are made in order to help with organization and solve any structure related problem without much complexity. These policies are meant to work in parallel. Overall, the combination of an involved team and a good and structured Branching Policy help with the correct development of the projects.


To determine the advantages of Branching Policies we will work with the most common ones, which include Trunk-Based Development (This one is less used and outdated nowadays) and Feature Branching Development (This is the one currently being used by most companies).
